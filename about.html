    <h2>What is Crochet?</h2>
    <p>
      Crochet is a craft where yarn or thread is interlocked 
      using a single hooked needle to create fabric. By making 
      a foundation chain and working various stitches—like single,
       double, half double, and treble crochet—crafters build up 
       rows of fabric with different textures and heights. 
       This technique is versatile, allowing the creation of items 
       such as blankets, garments, and accessories.
      Crochet projects can range from simple to complex, and the 
      choice of yarn and hook size influences the final result.
    </p>
    <h2>Types of Crochet</h2>
    <p>
      <h3>Tapestry Crochet</h3>
      <p>Tapestry crochet involves using multiple colors in a 
        single row to create intricate patterns and designs. 
        By working over the unused yarn to carry it along the back of the piece, 
        you achieve complex, colorful patterns without changing yarn frequently. 
        It’s commonly used for creating geometric designs and detailed motifs in 
        items like bags and blankets.</p>
      <h3>Mosiac Crochet</h3>
      <p>Mosaic crochet uses a combination of two or more colors, typically changing 
        colors every few rows or rounds. By working with slip stitches and half double 
        crochets, you create patterns with contrasting colors that appear as if they are 
        woven into the fabric. This technique is ideal for creating bold, graphic designs 
        with a striking visual effect.</p>
      <h3>Intarsia Crochet</h3>
      <p>Intarsia crochet involves working with separate yarn sections to create distinct 
        blocks of color within a piece. Each color section is worked with its own yarn, 
        and the yarns are twisted together at color changes to avoid gaps. This technique 
        is perfect for creating large, detailed images or patterns, such as pictures or motifs.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Types of Stitches</h2>
    <p>
        <h3> Single Crochet (sc)</h3>
        <p>
          A basic, tight stitch where you insert the hook into the stitch, yarn
          over, pull up a loop, yarn over again, and pull through both loops on
          the hook. It creates a dense, sturdy fabric.

        </p>
        <h3>Double Crochet (dc)</h3>
        <p>
          A taller stitch where you yarn over before inserting the hook into the
          stitch, yarn over again to pull up a loop, yarn over and pull through
          the first two loops, then yarn over again to pull through the
          remaining two loops. It creates a more open and airy fabric than
          single crochet.
        </p>
        <img src="dc 1 copy.jpg" alt="Crocheted fabric" />
        <h3>Treble Crochet (tc)</h3>
        <p>
          A tall stitch where you yarn over twice before inserting the hook into
          the stitch, yarn over and pull up a loop, yarn over and pull through
          two loops three times. It creates a very tall and open fabric, great
          for lacy patterns.
        </p>
        <img src="tr.jpg" alt="Crocheted fabric" />
        <h3>Half Double Crochet (hdc)</h3>
        <p>
          This stitch is between single and double crochet in height. Yarn over,
          insert the hook into the stitch, yarn over again to pull up a loop,
          yarn over once more and pull through all three loops on the hook. It
          creates a medium-height, textured fabric.

        </p>
        <h3>Modified Single Crochet (msc)</h3>
        <p>
          A variation of single crochet that creates a slightly taller, textured
          stitch. Insert the hook into the stitch, yarn over and pull up a loop,
          then yarn over and pull through just the first loop on the hook,
          followed by yarn over and pulling through both loops. It produces a
          fabric with a bit more height and texture than standard single
          crochet.

    <h2>Types of Yarn</h2>
    <p>
      
      <h3>Acrylic</h3>
      <p>Acrylic yarn is a synthetic fiber that is 
        lightweight, durable, and easy to care for. 
        It is available in a vast array of colors and
         is often more affordable than natural fibers. 
         Acrylic is resistant to mildew and fading, 
         making it a popular choice for beginners and 
         for projects that require machine washing,
          like blankets and toys.</p>
          <h3>Wool</h3>
          <p>Wool yarn is a natural fiber derived from sheep,
             known for its warmth, elasticity, and breathability.
              It can be slightly more expensive than synthetic
               yarns but offers excellent insulation, making it 
               ideal for cozy garments and accessories. Wool also 
               has natural moisture-wicking properties and can be 
               dyed in vibrant colors.</p>
               <h3>Cotton</h3>
               <p>
                Cotton yarn is a natural fiber that is soft, breathable, 
                and highly absorbent. It has a smooth texture, making it perfect 
                for summer garments, dishcloths, and home decor items. While cotton
                doesn’t have the stretch of wool, it holds its shape well and
                 is available in a variety of weights and colors.
               </p>
               <h3>Bamboo</h3>
               <p>
                Bamboo yarn is made from the cellulose of the bamboo plant, 
                offering a silky texture and natural sheen. It is soft,
                 breathable, and has antibacterial properties, 
                 making it a great choice for lightweight garments 
                 and baby items. Bamboo yarn drapes beautifully but 
                 can be prone to stretching.
               </p>
               <h3>Alpaca</h3>
               <p>
                Alpaca yarn is made from the fleece of alpacas and is
                known for its exceptional warmth and softness. 
                It is lightweight, hypoallergenic, and has a 
                luxurious feel, making it ideal for high-end garments 
                and accessories. Alpaca yarn comes in various natural 
                colors and is often blended with other fibers for 
                added durability.
               </p>
               <h3>Silk</h3>
               <p>
                Silk yarn is derived from the cocoons of silkworms and 
                is prized for its luxurious texture and natural luster. 
                It drapes beautifully and has a unique sheen, making it
                 perfect for elegant garments and accessories. Silk yarn 
                 can be blended with other fibers to enhance its durability 
                 and versatility.
